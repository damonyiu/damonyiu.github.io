                    <p> I helped manage the daily operations of the Software System Student Society, including
                        recruiting sponsors and creating sponsorship packages. I supported fellow executives with tasks
                        and worked closely with the Internal Representative to ensure external representation.
                        Additionally, I attended external meetings as a society representative when needed.</p>

                        Additionally, I prioritized orders and assisted delivery drivers during peak times to maintain

                        them to have their voter information card and ID ready. Additionally, I provided assistance to
